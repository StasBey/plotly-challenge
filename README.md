## Project
### Interactive dashboard using D3 to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
  - Chart 1: horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs* found in that individual, using sample_values as the values, otu_ids as the labels, and otu_labels as the hovertext.

- Chart 2: bubble chart that displays each sample, using otu_ids for the x values, sample_values for the y values, sample_values for the marker size, otu_ids for the marker colors, and otu_labels for the text values.

 - Table 1: sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information, displaying each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object.

 - Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.

### Findings

A small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### Notes

OTUs: microbial species, also called operational taxonomic units
